**Off the Grid…and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning Design**

I enjoyed reading this piece and learning about how in the past 20 years the U.S. has been trending toward traditional street grid and walkability in city centers. I am encouraged by the “promising though preliminary trend” towards proper street grid. I am not in the transportation concentration, so one thing that stood out was the argument that the culture of individual automobiles is bad for physical health. This obviously makes sense, but I had not seen that argument used alongside climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of research, some things that stood out to me were the extreme detail and the scale. Each individual city was analyzed in order to make a statement about the U.S. as a whole. Another thing that stood out was the conclusion that increased walkability in cities is driven by money. Everything is driven by money. But, in this case, traditional networks provide walkability which is appealing to today’s U.S. city dwellers. 

**OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks**

The uses of OSMnx seem endless. I am amazed by the ability to construct, project, visualize, analyze and subsequently compare across complex street networks. The coding involved went a little over my head. But, Figure 9 comparing Portland, San Francisco, Irvine and Rome really showed what OSMnx is all about. This tool could be useful in Sara and my project considering green space and crime. A street grid component may reveal itself as relevant. 

How are you thinking about street grids and public space in the age of Covid-19?
How do you think Covid-19 has impacted and will continue to impact the future of personal vehicle transportation?
