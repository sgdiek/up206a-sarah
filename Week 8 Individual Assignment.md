I picked this article because the first key word was “climate change policy” and I am interested in climate change adaption.
Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball frame their research by emphasizing the connection between greenhouse gas emissions and street networks.
The permanence of streets makes street patterns very important in terms of climate change adaption.
A city’s highly connected street network has the potential to facilitate sustainable energy use and reduce CO2 emissions.
A city’s poorly connected street network has the potential to bar environmental progress in many ways for centuries to come. 
North America seems to have the most variation over time in street connectivity with a trend toward sprawl until 2000 and then a reduction in sprawl from 2000-2014.
Maybe we are moving in the right direction?

It was interesting to see the suggestion of prohibiting gated communities.
I hadn’t ever thought much about gated communities but I see how they are the absolute worst thing you could plan for street connectivity.

One high level takeaway was that open street maps is incredibly impressive.
I didn’t know it had any bike and pedestrian paths so I am impressed to know it does even if its potentially not complete and led to some underestimates of connectivity in certain walkable/bikeable places.
Finally, reading this piece taught me what the words dendritic and exurban mean. :) 


## Questions

1. One question I have is what platform/software was used to create the visuals in this piece? (the graphs and the grid maps)

2. What is considered a D-3 street network? I see that South Africa is considered D-3 but I don’t see a definition of D-3. It’s in-between Grid and Irregular grid so it seems quite difficult to differentiate.
