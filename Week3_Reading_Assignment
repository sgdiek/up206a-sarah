*Off the Grid…and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning Design*
I enjoyed reading this piece and learning about how in the past 20 years the U.S. has been trending toward traditional street grid and walkability in city centers. I am encouraged by the “promising though preliminary trend” towards proper street grid. I am not in the transportation concentration, so one thing that stood out was the argument that the culture of individual automobiles is bad for physical health. This obviously makes sense, but I had not seen that argument used alongside climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of research, some things that stood out to me were the extreme detail and the scale. Each individual city was analyzed in order to make a statement about the U.S. as a whole. Another thing that stood out was the conclusion that increased walkability in cities is driven by money. Everything is driven by money. But, in this case, traditional networks provide walkability which is appealing to today’s U.S. city dwellers. 

How are you thinking about public space and street grids in the age of Covid-19?
