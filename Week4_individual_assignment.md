For the mapathon, I watched **Ben Welsh’s presentation**. First of all, I thought it was great.
He is the head of data and graphics at LA Times. I liked his 3-part presentation on applications, visual stories and digital designs.
It was cool to see some of his examples of articles that I read in real time like the Kobe Bryant visual story.
I am amazed by the range that a data journalist must have to be able to cover the application stories including elections and police shootings but also stories
on unhoused people in LA through visual stories.

**A couple random thoughts**

- I am looking forward to the LA Times year in review that he gave us a small glimpse of.
- It is fascinating that the corona virus tracker is the most visited page of LA Times ever. (Makes sense because we are all at home with nothing else to do.)

My main take away was that you need a main takeaway. I think this will be relevant for our midterm and our final project.
Ben was talking about what he looks for in an applicant and it was someone who’s work has a headline, a point, tells a story.
I will keep this in mind for my research project. Finally, shoutout to Mr. and Mrs. Outlier and Mr. and Mrs. Central tendency.
